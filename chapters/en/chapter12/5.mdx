    json={
        'model': 'llama2',
        'prompt': 'Explain quantum computing',
        'system': 'You are a helpful assistant',
        'format': 'json',
        'options': {
            'temperature': 0.7,
            'top_p': 0.9,
            'num_ctx': 4096
        }
    })
```

2. **Custom Model Creation**:
```python
# Example Modelfile
"""
FROM llama2
PARAMETER temperature 0.7
