# TGI and vLLM

In this chapter, we'll explore two powerful frameworks for serving Large Language Models (LLMs) in production: Text Generation Inference (TGI) and vLLM. Both frameworks are designed to optimize LLM inference and make deployment easier and more efficient.

## Text Generation Inference (TGI)

Text Generation Inference (TGI) is a production-ready serving stack developed by Hugging Face for deploying and serving Large Language Models. It's the backbone of Hugging Chat and is designed to provide optimal performance while maintaining ease of use.

### Key Features of TGI

1. **Advanced Memory Management**
   - Implements Flash Attention 2 for efficient attention computation
   - Uses Paged Attention for optimal memory usage
   - Supports both CPU and GPU offloading for weights and past key values

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Continuous batching for maximum throughput
   - Token streaming via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
   - Support for various quantization methods (bitsandbytes, GPT-Q)

3. **Deployment Features**
   - Docker containers for easy deployment
   - Kubernetes-ready with helm charts
   - Built-in monitoring with Prometheus metrics
   - Safety features like token limiting and content filtering

### Deployment Options

TGI offers several deployment methods:

1. **Docker (Recommended)**
```bash
docker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 \
    ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:latest \
    --model-id HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct
```

2. **Python Package**
```bash
pip install text-generation
python -m text_generation_launcher --model-id HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct
```

### Using TGI in Production

#### REST API Integration

The REST API supports both chat and completion endpoints:

```python
import requests

def generate_text(prompt, api_url="http://localhost:8080"):
    response = requests.post(
        f"{api_url}/generate",
        json={
            "inputs": prompt,
            "parameters": {
                "max_new_tokens": 50,
                "temperature": 0.7,
                "top_p": 0.95,
                "repetition_penalty": 1.1
            }
        }
    )
    return response.json()

# Example usage
result = generate_text("Explain quantum computing in simple terms")
```

#### Streaming Responses

For real-time applications, TGI supports token streaming:

```python
from text_generation import Client

client = Client("http://localhost:8080")
text = ""

# Stream tokens
for response in client.generate_stream(
    "What is artificial intelligence?",
    max_new_tokens=100,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_k=50,
    top_p=0.95
):
    if not response.token.special:
        text += response.token.text
        print(text, end="", flush=True)
```

## vLLM

vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference engine for LLMs. It introduces PagedAttention, a novel attention algorithm that significantly improves memory efficiency and enables continuous batching.

### PagedAttention Deep Dive

PagedAttention revolutionizes how KV-cache is managed:

1. **Memory Management**
   - Divides KV-cache into fixed-size blocks (pages)
   - Enables non-contiguous memory allocation
   - Reduces memory fragmentation by up to 47%

2. **Performance Benefits**
   - Up to 24x higher throughput compared to traditional methods
   - Supports dynamic sequence lengths
   - Enables efficient memory sharing across requests

### Advanced Features

1. **Distributed Inference**
```python
from vllm import LLM
from vllm.engine.arg_utils import AsyncEngineArgs

# Initialize distributed setup
engine_args = AsyncEngineArgs(
    model="HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct",
    tensor_parallel_size=4,  # Use 4 GPUs
    gpu_memory_utilization=0.85,
    max_num_batched_tokens=8192
)

llm = LLM(engine_args=engine_args)
```

2. **Custom Sampling Strategies**
```python
from vllm import SamplingParams

# Advanced sampling configuration
params = SamplingParams(
    temperature=0.8,
    top_p=0.95,
    top_k=50,
    presence_penalty=0.1,
    frequency_penalty=0.1,
    max_tokens=100,
    stop=["###", "\n\n"]
)

outputs = llm.generate(["Tell me a story"], sampling_params=params)
```

### Performance Monitoring

vLLM provides built-in performance metrics:

```python
from vllm.core.metrics import measure_throughput

@measure_throughput
def batch_inference(prompts):
    return llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)

# Monitor performance
metrics = batch_inference(["Prompt 1", "Prompt 2", "Prompt 3"])
print(f"Throughput: {metrics['throughput']} tokens/sec")
```
