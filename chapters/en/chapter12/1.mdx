# Inference

Inference is the process of using a trained language model to generate predictions or responses. While inference might seem straightforward, deploying models efficiently at scale requires careful consideration of various factors like performance, cost, and reliability. Large Language Models (LLMs) present unique challenges due to their size and computational requirements.

We'll explore both simple and production-ready approaches using the [`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library and [`text-generation-inference`](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference), two popular frameworks for LLM inference. For production deployments, we'll focus on Text Generation Inference (TGI), which provides optimized serving capabilities.

## Module Overview

LLM inference can be categorized into two main approaches: simple pipeline-based inference for development and testing, and optimized serving solutions for production deployments. We'll cover both approaches, starting with the simpler pipeline approach and moving to production-ready solutions.
